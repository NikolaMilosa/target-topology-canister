# Target topology canister

The canister for displaying detailed information about the proposals for the community and other reviewers.

## Left TODO:

* add the proposals related to a subnet in subnet detail view.

* Add methods that acutally sync data from governance canister
* Add methods that actually sync data from registry canister
* Add a way to remove proposals if they are not open anymore
* Add a way to remove draft if they have been open for too long or if they have been proposed
* Add support for specifing the user that has created a draft proposal
* Add special target topology constraints for some subnets for some features for some values
* Make the canister actually generate the proposal summary and others just consume it (maybe not the best idea for the beginning.)
* Set timestamp to now for drafts and display when they were created.
